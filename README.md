## Hardware

* Nucleo-F446RE (STM32F446RET6)
* OLED Display SSD1306 (width 128, height 32)
* ...

## Bug

* After system freeze, normal upload will not reset the board correctly, need to press the RESET button
* Sometimes OLED screen fail to initiate, seems to be hardware issue. Hard stop added to help detect this issue early on
* xTimerStart does not work, need to use xTimerChangePeriodFromISR() even from task
* Force sensor box stuck in 485 auto upload readings mode. Reset the box wont help; box is not responding to any commands
* If multipule UART_Tansmit_DMA functions were called, the later ones are sometimes not working

## TODO

* [ ] Stepper control
* [ ] Motion
* [X] Migrate command execution from UART callback to dedicated Command task
* [X] Limit switch
* [X] Command execution
* [X] Robot state
* [X] Update connection diagram
* [X] Capture return error from ssdWriteString
* [ ] Use FreeRTOS queue, Semaphore, Event, etc
* [ ] EEPROM
* [X] Add logic 2 catpure

## Fixed Issue

* During debug session, system goes to Hard Fault after osDelay : task stack size too small
* Sometimes PlatformIO need to build twice to build successfully, or after Clean All
* sprintf print use big flash size. Switch to customized printf, see printf.c and printf.h
* [Linux RS485 to USB device cannot connect]([https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/670636/unable-to-use-usb-dongle-based-on-usb-serial-converter-chip](https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/670636/unable-to-use-usb-dongle-based-on-usb-serial-converter-chip))
* Some serial port monitor software is inconsistent at higher baudrate. Enable USB_ECHO to check communication
* OLED task delays timer callback, fixed by switching to driver with DMA mode
* Force sensor: Rx DMA read to idle should restart in UART callback, but failed after running for 10mins at 20Hz. Cannot find the bug. Solution:move Rx DMA restart inside Tx timer callback
* Stepper_GetSpeedLeveltofree: when spped is negative and levels >3, freeze (memory size bug: malloc (size * sizeof(float)));)
